* **About:**
  - A Simple blog website made with *PHP* and *MySQL* has basic functions like adding, editing and removing posts. Registration system allows users to have access to only their made posts and so this prevents from any ill intention, as well as having all of their posts together under one page.
  - Adding and/or editing allows users to include an image of their own. There is a build-in image crop *jQuery plugin* called *"Jcrop"* from *Deep Liquid*, so the uploaded image fits the flow of the page better. Images are uploaded to a free file cloud called *"Cloudinary"*. There is also a simple text editor *"CKEditor"* for more interesting formatting of the content.
  - The Footer contains an email form for newsletter and some social media icons.
* **Things i would do differently now:**
  - Unfortunately, i did underestimate everything. And so i abandoned this project altogether. I wanted to have it more functions and do more work on it, but there's simply no point in continuing with this. It's better to move onto something else with this new gained knowledge.
  - I would go with React and Laravel framework for sure. Not using anything was a mistake and later even pain to do anything. I would look into Sass or Less too, css became a bit of a mess.
  - The image crop plugin is a not that good, works good enough, but i'm not happy with it.

At the end, i started to hate this project and it became hard to work on it. But i have to admit, i learned a ton from this and so i'm glad i did this.
